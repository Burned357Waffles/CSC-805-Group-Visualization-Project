Description of the 3 remaining pages:

State Profile page

The State Profile page is a deep dive for one state. Conceptually, it uses the same data columns as the overview, but always filtered to:

state_usps == selectedState, and

whichever week/time window the page’s controls specify.

Key pieces:

State-level KPI ribbon – same as Overview, but no national mode.

State vaccination coverage time series – three lines from:

vacc_pct_any_18p, vacc_pct_full_18p, booster_pct_18p.

State cases & deaths time series:

weekly_cases_per_100k (upper chart),

weekly_deaths_per_100k (lower chart).

Lagged outcome scatter:

X: coverage (vacc_pct_any_18p or vacc_pct_full_18p).

Y: lagged weekly outcomes (weekly_deaths_per_100k or weekly_cases_per_100k at t+L).

Mini hesitancy context panel:

hesitancy_pct for that state,

final-week coverage (e.g., vacc_pct_any_18p at last week_end_date),

derived “reachable coverage” ≈ coverage_final / (100 - hesitancy_pct).

All of these are pure re-uses of the same columns; there are no new data sources.

Compare States page

This page overlays multiple states to compare them.

Main elements and columns:

KPI area:

One full ribbon for a “primary” state or US, using the same columns and logic as other ribbons (from state_week.csv or nat_week.csv).

A compact table for a handful of selected states:

vacc_pct_any_18p

weekly_cases_per_100k

weekly_deaths_per_100k

hesitancy_pct
at the chosen week_end_date.

Multi-state vaccination time series:

For each selected state: line of vacc_pct_any_18p over time.

Multi-state cases time series:

For each selected state: line of weekly_cases_per_100k over time.

Multi-state deaths time series:

For each selected state: line of weekly_deaths_per_100k over time.

Vaccination vs outcome (lagged) bubble chart:

For week t (in the chosen range) and lag L:

X: coverage (vacc_pct_any_18p or vacc_pct_full_18p) at week t.

Y: outcome (either weekly_cases_per_100k or weekly_deaths_per_100k) at week (t + L).

Bubble size or color optionally tied to hesitancy_pct or population.

So again: no new columns, just different combinations and lags of the same ones.

Hesitancy vs Uptake page

This page focuses on relationship between hesitancy and vaccination coverage.

Key visuals and their data:

Scatter: hesitancy vs coverage (single week)

For the chosen week t:

X: hesitancy_pct (fixed baseline, from state_week.csv).

Y: coverage at that week:

vacc_pct_any_18p or vacc_pct_full_18p depending on a dropdown.

Optional:

Ghost point at final coverage (vacc_pct_* at last week) for each state.

Longitudinal paths (start vs end)

For each selected state:

Start point: (hesitancy_pct, coverage at first week).

End point: (hesitancy_pct, coverage at end week defined by the Week slider).

Coverage always comes from vacc_pct_any_18p or vacc_pct_full_18p.

Filter rail on this page controls:

Which states to include,

Week t,

Which coverage metric (vacc_pct_any_18p or vacc_pct_full_18p),

Whether bubble area is scaled by population,

Whether to show labels.

Everything still uses only:

hesitancy_pct,

vacc_pct_any_18p,

vacc_pct_full_18p,

population (for bubble size).
